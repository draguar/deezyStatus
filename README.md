2. Install the Firefox add-on [DeezyTracker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/deezytracker/)..
   
## How it Works

Once you've set up DeezyTracker and play music in Deezer, it will send the current track information to DeezyStatus. This information will then update your Slack status automatically.
